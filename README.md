# Space Invaders in Python

## Overview
This project was initially my A-Level coursework. Included in that, was some extra functionality including a "Theory" window explaining the basics of Python and TKinter. However, that functionality was not necessary for this version of the source code, and as such has been removed for simplicity.

## Running the program
In order to run the program, follow the steps below
- Download Python and add to environment variables (PATH)
- Open the folder in your command prompt from choice
- Run the command "py spaceInvaders.py" to start the program
- The program will start automatically, with the following player controls:
  - Left/Right arrows - move left and right
  - Up arrow - shoot
- Only one bullet can be shot at any time
